## Choice of Language : C++
- Allow me to manage the memory consumption "manually" : if I don't mess up, I might be able to have less memory lost than using python for example
- language oriented object : easier to define and categorize processes (especially with the thread class in our case)
- I am not familiar with object oriented programming, but I am quite familiar with C, so I hope it will help.
